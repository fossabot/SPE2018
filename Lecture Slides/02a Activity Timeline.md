Step-by-step guide to creating a work package timeline in Open Project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no quick and easy way to create a complex timeline (soz):
- It takes a lot of thought and hard work
- The whole thing starts out as a big mess to begin with
- But eventually Open Project will help you get it into shape !

Here are just a few tips and hints to make getting started with open project easier...

1. Brainstorm the major activities in your project (see "building your own house" example)
1. Log in to Open Project and go to the activity timeline in the work package section
1. Go to the ... menu and "Sort By" _start date_ (this will make things a lot tider later !)
    Note: You may periodically need to re-sort the timeline as work pacakges are added or moved
1. For each activity identified, create a new "Task" work package in Open Project and give it:
    - A suitable name (that actually means something useful)
    - A start date (just choose "today" for simplicity - you can move it later)
    - An end date (again, just click on tomorrow's date for simplicity)
1. With a few work packages it starts to get hard to cope ! Organise them into _phase_ clusters by:
    - Creating a new _phase_, giving it a name, start date (today) end date (the following day)
    - Save the phase to the database before continuing on to the next step...
    - Click on the _relations_ tab of the phase and add some existing child tasks to it
    - You will need to make use of the search feature to making finding child tasks easier !
    - Alternatively you can do it in the _relations_ tab of the task, by adding a suitable _parent_ phase
1. Create dependencies between work packages by right-clicking on a task and selecting:
    **Add Predecessor** and **Add follower**. Start by creating dependencies only between
    tasks in the same phase. Then add dependencies between tasks in different phases.
1. If you see a task in a position where it can't possibly be, the you have probably missed a dependency !
1. Create some _milestone_ tasks, giving them a name and today's date. Once created, link them in by:
    - Positioning them structurally by adding them as a child to a _phase_
    - Positioning them chronologically by indicating their _Predecessor_
1. Drag the start and end dates of the task to appropriate days. The whole diagram should update,
    with dependencies being respected and related tasks being shuffled around to fit !

Finally:
- Don't expect to create the whole timeline upfront and in one go.
- Be as detailed as you can early on.
- Your timeline will expand and extend as time progresses
- Don't forget to keep it updated as you go along !!!
